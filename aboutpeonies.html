            <h2>How to Grow and Keep Peonies Alive?</h2>
            <p>Peonies are relatively easy to grow and can live for decades with proper care. Here are some tips to ensure your peonies thrive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Planting Location:</strong> Choose a location with well-drained soil, full sun, and space for the peonies to grow to their full size. Avoid planting in areas that are too wet or shaded.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Preparation:</strong> Peonies prefer rich, loamy soil. Before planting, amend the soil with compost or organic matter to improve its drainage and fertility.</li>
                <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Water peonies regularly, but avoid overwatering. They prefer deep, infrequent watering to promote strong root growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Use a balanced fertilizer or one low in nitrogen during the growing season to support healthy growth and flowering.</li>
                <li><strong>Winter Care:</strong> In colder climates, protect peonies by cutting them back in the fall and covering them with mulch to prevent frost damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Deadhead spent flowers throughout the blooming season to encourage new growth. After the growing season, cut back the plant to ground level once the foliage has died back.</li>
            </ul>
